### What we are

### What we are not

- It's not the Internet Archive, though IA sometimes generously offers to host or support our projects
- We are not a for-profit venture
- We are publicly accountable but invite only; our success relies on our members having a safe place to work where trust can be assured and their privacy respected.
- We are not an organization which may speak to the press as or on behalf of Archive Labs. Its members are free to speak to media about projects they work on and are premitted to voice their association as Labs fellows, however members are not permitted to voice association or speak on behalf of others working on Labs projects without their expressed permission. (e.g. Look what Labs fellow made -- good! Look what Archive Labs built -- not ok!)

## Projects
- Decentralized Web - version control, persistence, and document integrity should be built into the fabric of the world wide web. Weâ€™re dedicated to fostering a community whose experiments give such ideas a fighting chance.
- Government Data Archival - We offer a space for discussion where institutions can come together to ensure the survival of important data (e.g. public Nasa and environment data) so it can be preserved when projects no longer have the ability to sustain or fund hosting. 
- Open Access Scholarly Works - Fellows from the community help organize and contribute to the Open Journal Foundation, a project which connects and unites like-minded institutions in offering better access to (and encouraging open publishing of) open access scholarly works.
